    {"role": "1", "text": "That is amazing! It helps condition the plasma-facing surfaces and keeps things running smoothly!"},
    {"role": "0", "text": "And get this! Visible line emission from oxygen and tungsten drops by up to eighty percent with boron injection!"},
    {"role": "1", "text": "Wow! That is a huge reduction especially in L-mode and H-mode discharges using the new tungsten monoblock lower divertor!"},
