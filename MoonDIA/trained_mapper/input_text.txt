Abstract
Boron powder dropped into KSTAR plasmas decreased the radiated power, core electron density, and 
, indicating that the ablated and redeposited boron powder helped to condition the plasma-facing surfaces. Visible line emission of oxygen and tungsten were also reduced by 50% (80%) with boron injection into H-mode (L-mode) discharges that used the new KSTAR tungsten monoblock lower divertor. Dynamic particle balance analysis found a negligible difference in the inferred wall pumping rate during the steady portion of the discharges. It is inferred that the observed conditioning effects were principally caused by a reduction in intrinsic impurities as opposed to a reduction in wall recycling. These results are in qualitative agreement with low-Z injected powder experiments across many fusion devices, confirming the utility of low-Z powder injection as a real-time wall conditioning tool.

1. Introduction
High concentrations of impurities are undesirable in fusion plasmas due to their contribution to radiative power losses and their negative impact on plasma stability and energy confinement [1]. Various methods of wall conditioning have been used in fusion devices to control the influx of intrinsic impurities to the plasma. These methods include glow discharge cleaning to remove implanted wall impurities [2] and deposition of oxygen getter materials on the first wall [3].

Boron is an effective oxygen getter [4], and boronization is a commonly used method of wall conditioning that has been employed in various devices including TEXTOR [5], ASDEX/-Upgrade [6, 7], DIII-D [8], NSTX/-U [9, 10], EAST [11], W7-X [12], and KSTAR [13]. Boronization has resulted in advantageous effects, including reduced carbon and oxygen impurity levels, reduced core power radiation, and higher density operation.

Boronization is of particular interest for devices with high Z first walls and divertors. High Z impurities are of particular concern for fusion device operation since they radiate higher amounts of power from the plasma core than low Z impurities. Tungsten has been chosen as the material for both the first wall and divertor plasma-facing components (PFCs) of various devices, including ASDEX-Upgrade [14], WEST [15], and ITER [16]. While its chemical and thermomechanical properties are advantageous within the context of fusion devices [17], minimizing the sputtering of W is important to enable high-performance operation. The effects of boronization on full-metal walls have been studied previously in experimental devices such as AUG, EAST, WEST, and Alcator C-Mod. For example, in AUG, which has a full W first-wall, boronization has been shown to reduce oxygen and carbon concentrations, lower 
 in the core, and reduce core W concentration and its associated radiative losses [18]. In Alcator C-Mod, which featured molybdenum PFCs, discharges after boronization resulted in higher energy confinement, lower 
, lower radiated power, and higher stored energy compared to discharges before boronization [19].

Boron coatings have been traditionally applied during a glow discharge. During a glow discharge boronization (GDB) , a boron gas (typically deuterated diborane B2D6 or trimethylboron B(CD3)3) is injected during a glow discharge with a carrier gas (typically He) [1]. However, a glow discharge cannot be sustained in presence of strong magnetic fields. Because of this, in fusion devices using superconducting coils [20], glow-discharge boronization is limited to designated maintenance periods with de-energized coils. In addition, long-pulse operations will cause the boron coatings in high plasma-flux regions to erode, possibly within a single plasma discharge. Impurity powder droppers (IPDs) [21] have been used to develop a method of boronization in which the B layers are deposited during plasma discharges. While the exact amount of B powder required for effective replenishment of B layers and duration of those resulting layers are still being investigated, IPDs can be used to re-condition plasma-facing surfaces without halting operations. ITER has recently updated its design to a full-W wall, a change that will require the use of boron coatings to mitigate W sputtering, principally associated with intrinsic oxygen. The use of GDB has been added to the ITER research plan [16, 22], and solid boron injection, in form of powder or pellets, is under evaluation as a risk mitigation measure to achieve the Q = 10 mission [23, 24].

IPDs have been used in several magnetic confinement devices, including ASDEX-Upgrade [25, 26], DIII-D [27, 28], EAST [29–31], KSTAR [32], LHD [33, 34], and WEST [35, 36]. A compact impurity powder injection device has also been deployed on W7-X [37]. In all these devices, boron powder injection (BPI) resulted in enhanced wall conditions similar to GDB—reduction of radiative losses, influx of high-Z impurities, impurity concentration, and wall fueling are commonly observed. These findings confirm the potential of solid boron injection as a real-time wall conditioning technique in long-pulse devices. This work reports results of experiments of real-time wall conditioning through B powder injection conducted in the KSTAR tokamak after the recent installation of the new tungsten divertor. The experiments leveraged KSTAR’s long pulse capabilities and explored BPI in both L- and H-mode confinement regimes.

2. Experiment overview
2.1. KSTAR
KSTAR is a medium-sized superconducting tokamak, with a major radius R = 1.8 m, minor radius a = 0.5 m, toroidal magnetic field 
  T, plasma current 
  MA, elongation 
, and triangularity 
 [38, 39]. The main auxiliary heating is provided by two neutral beam injection (NBI) systems, each with three sources, that can deliver power in excess of 12 MW [40, 41]. Additionally, four gyrotrons can deliver up to 3.8 MW of electron cyclotron heating (ECH) [42]. The first wall of KSTAR was originally covered by ∼3400 graphite tiles. In 2023, the lower divertor was upgraded to an ITER-like water-cooled tungsten monoblock cassette divertor [43], consisting of 64 toroidal divertor cassette modules designed to withstand a heat flux of 10  WM−1 [44]. The experiments presented in this work are the first BPI experiments with the tungsten divertor. Prior to the experimental campaign, which started in December 2023, standard wall conditioning procedures were applied. This included baking of PFCs vacuum vessel (
 C) and pumping duct (
 C). The baking process lowered the base pressure to 
 Torr. GDC was also carried out, in combination with the vacuum bake, to further reduce the number of oxygen-containing impurities in the vacuum vessel and PFCs [43].

2.2. Impurity powder dropper (IPD)
This experiment utilized PPPL’s IPD, in operation in KSTAR since 2018 [32]. The IPD is equipped with four powder reservoirs that are operated independently of each other by applying a sinusoidal voltage to the piezo-electric actuators at the desired reservoir’s resonant frequency. This results in a powder discharge into a drop tube and eventually to the plasma. The drop rate is controlled by varying the applied voltage. An in-depth description of the IPD and its operation is provided in Nagy et al [21]. Commercially available B powder with 
  µm granule size (100 mesh), and 99.9% purity was used. The flow rate and cumulative powder amounts reported in this work were calculated using the flowmeter signal, which consists of a collimated light-gate intercepting the vertical flow of powder. The measured attenuation is mapped to mass drop rates between 
 mg s−1 according to a prior powder-specific calibration. In KSTAR, the IPD is installed above the cryostat (figure 1(a)). The distance between the powder feeders and the plasma edge is approximately 4.5 m. The end of the drop tube is located at major radius R = 1.8 m and elevation Z = 0.9 m (figure 1(b), green arrow). The delay between a feeder energization and the time when the boron powder reaches the plasma is approximately 2.2 s. This delay time was measured combining diagnostics integrated into the IPD, and corroborated with the visible wide-angle camera system. A still image taken from the visible camera during BPI shows bright flecks of boron particles (figure 1(c)). These particles enter in contact with the plasma off-frame, at a toroidal angle not in view, and move from top left toward the bottom right.

2.3. Diagnostics
The plasma density was measured using the two-color interferometer (TCI) system at KSTAR [45]. This system consists of five different chords, which measure the line-averaged plasma density at different R values. In this work, the channel reported as the ‘central’ or ‘core’ channel corresponds to channel 2, which is just inboard of the magnetic axis and has a tangency radius of 1.78 m, and a chord length of 5.51 m. The channel reported as the ‘peripheral’ channel is channel 5, which corresponds to the outer midplane, with a tangency radius of 2.16 m and a chord length of 2.52 m. The locations of these channels with respect to the separatrix and magnetic axis are shown in figure 1(b)). The uncertainty associated with this type of density measurement is 
. The electron temperature was measured using the electron cyclotron emission radiometer (ECE) system [46]. The core electron temperature reported in this work was measured at R = 1.79 m, the same radial location as the core electron density.

The spectroscopic measurements used in this work are measured using the visible survey spectrometer and the filterscope system [47]. The B-II (412.2 nm) and O-II (441.5 nm) emission intensities reported in this work were collected using the survey spectrometer system and the relevant wavelength signals were isolated in post-processing. The spectra were collected using OceanFX spectrometers, which are manufactured by Ocean Optics [48] and have a ∼1.5 nm optical resolution. The W-I (400.9 nm) and C-III (464.7 nm) line emission intensities were collected using the filterscope system. To measure these emission lines, two channels of the poloidal visible filterscope system were equipped with bandpass filters manufactured by Andover Corporation [49]. The central wavelengths of these filters were 400.9 nm and 464.7 nm for the W-I and C-III emission lines, respectively. Each filter had a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. These spectroscopy signals were collected with chords located at the midplane and pointing towards the lower divertor (figure 1(b)). The dark background values were measured by averaging the spectrometer signals before plasma startup (
 s). Advanced background subtraction techniques were not implemented at the time of this experiment. Aside from the 1.0 nm bandpass filter, there were no other techniques implemented to screen for other impurities. However, previous work from DIII-D has shown that the W-I line tends to dominate the emission over any other common impurities within a +/- 3 nm range of the spectra [50], and similar observations were made on DIII-D and NSTX with respect to the C-III line. After background subtraction, the spectroscopy and filterscope signals were normalized by the edge electron density measured by TCI system. In order to assess systematic, shot-to-shot, evolution of impurity effects, the normalized brightness of lines of interest were measured before boron injection (‘pre-drop phase’, and during boron injection, after B has already reached the plasma during that discharge (‘drop phase’). For the L-mode discharges, t = 3 s is chosen as representative of the ‘pre-drop’ measurement, and t = 4.9 s is chosen as representative of the ‘drop’ phase. In the H-mode discharges, t = 5 s was used as the ‘pre-drop’ measurement, and t = 12.4 s as the ‘drop’ measurement. To measure the change in the overall impurity level in plasmas, the effective charge (
) profiles were obtained from the toroidal visible Bremsstrahlung filterscope system [51].
