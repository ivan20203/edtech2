Abstract
An optical interlock protects the JET neutral beam ducts, connecting the neutral beam injection boxes to the tokamak, from damage if there is a fast pressure rise in the beam duct. Using results from the JET deuterium-tritium experimental campaign in 2021 (JET-DTE2), we demonstrate how the interlock will trip during fault conditions while avoiding false trips caused by background light from the plasma and the additional light from neutron radiation luminescence. During the DTE2 experiments, the rate of neutrons produced by the JET fusion reactions was up to 4.7 × 1018 n s−1. Light produced by neutron radiation in the system was measured with blind fibres. A false trip occurred during the experimental campaign which was due to radiation induced light in the optics. Calibration of the beam emission response to the duct pressure and the background light from Dα and Bremsstrahlung emission and the contribution from light generated by neutron radiation was done through the analysis of a database of pulses. Light measured in blind fibres was strongly correlated to neutron production rate. We show that compensation of the background due to radiation is possible and can significantly improve the performance of the interlock during JET fusion experiments. The interlock used annealed optical fibres heated to 200 °C to limit the attenuation from radiation damage. At the end of the JET-DTE2 campaign, accumulated radiation damage was at most 15% with some fibres showing no loss of transmission.

1. Introduction
Magnetically confined fusion experiments use neutral beam injection systems to provide auxiliary plasma heating, current drive and as a spectroscopic probe. The JET tokamak has two Neutral Injector Boxes (octant 4 and octant 8) [1] as shown in figure 1. Each injector box (octant 4 or octant 8) includes eight PINI (Positive Ion Neutral Injector) beam sources. The beam gas (helium, hydrogen, deuterium, tritium), and energy can be changed according to experimental requirements.

During the JET deuterium–tritium (D–T) experimental campaign in 2021 (referred here as JET-DTE2) the JET NBI system was operated with deuterium or tritium at 80–125 kV with a maximum beam current per PINI of 65 A, and a maximum injected power of 2.1 MW per PINI (34 MW total) [2, 3]. During JET-DTE2 octant 8 was mainly operated with deuterium, while octant 4 was mainly operated with tritium. Maintaining a low pressure (< 2 × 10−5 mbar) along the beam line is essential because the neutral beam particles can be re-ionised through electron stripping while travelling along the beam line [4]. A fraction of re-ionised particles will be deflected onto the beam duct wall (between the injector box and the tokamak) by the stray tokamak magnetic field causing localised heating. A runaway process can thus be triggered, where the localised heating causes wall outgassing, increased pressure in the duct and, in turn, even more ionisation and wall heating. This process where the duct pressure rapidly rises, and the beam can no longer propagate is called ‘beam-blocking’. It can potentially cause catastrophic damage. Significant damage to the JET neutral beam duct lining has occurred in the past [5, 6].

The gas re-emission coefficient, Γ, is the number of molecules released from the duct wall per incident ion and is used to measure the condition of the beam duct wall. Conditioning is the process where the beam power and pulse duration is slowly increased from pulse to pulse to heat the duct and trigger desorption of the gas trapped in the duct wall. Values of Γ = 0.5 to Γ = 33, the latter for an unconditioned beam duct, have been measured for the JET neutral beams [7], for an uncooled duct liner, before a major enhancement program for the NBI system in 2011, where an actively cooled duct wall liner was installed.

The ASDEX neutral beam system demonstrated that an optical Dα interlock can protect the beam duct from reionisation and beam blocking [8, 9]. The method was then used on the JET neutral beam Optical Duct Interlock (ODI) [6] to protect the beam duct from excessive thermal loads that occur when the beam is fully ionised. This optical system was required to provide a sufficiently fast (2 ms) response to pressure excursions as vacuum pressure gauges have a slower response time of the order of 20–50 ms. The requirement for a 2 ms response came from thermal engineering calculations of the fatigue lifetime of the hypervaoptron duct lining. Small angle collisions between the beam and the residual background gas excite Balmer-α emission (Hα at 656.3 nm, Dα at 656.104 nm, Tα at 656.045 nm). The emission depends on the beam flux, background gas pressure and the emission cross-section. The emission wavelength is Doppler shifted, this feature is used to distinguish beam emission, proportional to the duct pressure, from background plasma emission. The cross-section depends on the beam energy. The beam energy and current are fixed at the start of the heating pulse so changes in the beam emission are due to changes in the background gas pressure

The signal measured by the interlock includes significant background light from the plasma and parasitic light generated in optical fibres or viewing windows due to neutron radiation. To minimise background from the plasma, the ODI measurement line of sight does not look directly at the plasma, however, some light from the plasma can be reflected by the beam duct which has a shiny copper wall. Selecting the Doppler shifted emission reduces the background contribution from the plasma. The presence of copper sputtering can cause coating of the optical windows, and the light transmission can reduce over time. Because of this, windows were be removed and cleaned during maintenance shutdowns (as far as this was possible with respect to other JET schedule constraints).

The ODI relies on transmission via optical fibres which are affected by neutron radiation, as was clearly observed. The purpose of this work is to describe the operation of the ODI system during the JET DTE2 experiment. The paper is organised as follows: a brief description of the JET ODI system is given in section 2 along with a short literature review of neutron radiation effects in fibres. The operation of the system during campaign is described in section 3; the main contributors to the optical signal used for the interlock are discussed. In section 4, the capability of the system to detect pressure excursion events with an optimal compensation for neutrons induced light is analysed. Conclusions are drawn in section 5 with an emphasis on lessons learnt from the ODI system operation in the unique JET nuclear fusion environment.

2. ODI system description
2.1. Optical system
The ODI includes collection optics, fibre optic cables, detection optics, and signal conditioning/data acquisition. It provides inputs to and acts through the Fast Beam Interlock System [10].

Figure 2 shows a schematic of the interlock optics. In this paper a full description of the interlock is not given as this has been covered in another publication [6]. The beam emission from the neutral beam duct is observed through a diagnostic window.

There are eight neutral beams passing through the duct and on each NBI box, ODI measurements use four lines of sight (channel 2, 3, 4, 5) covering the full range of beam alignments. The light is collected with collimators (f = 7.5 mm) and coupled into optical fibres. In addition, one measurement channel on each octant is a blind fibre. On the blind fibre channel, the collimator has an aluminium lens cap to block light collection from the duct. This allows measurement of any light produced by radiation in the optical fibre and collimator.

The optical fibres are contained in an insulated hose which was heated to 200 °C. The hose leaves the torus hall through a sealed penetration in the biological shield. The fibres are routed though the basement to the diagnostic hall for measurement and data acquisition. Light from the fibre is collimated (f = 35 mm) into a beam and passes through an interference filter which selects the Doppler shifted Balmer-α light while blocking the unshifted Balmer-α light from the plasma and background gas. The filter has a 10 nm passband at 670 nm and is angle tuned to an optimal angle of 15° to attenuate the unshifted Balmer-α line (see figure 3). The transmission band was checked with a spectrometer. All the signal channels 2, 3, 4, 5 (octant 4 and octant 8) were fitted with an interference filter.

The light is measured by a photomultiplier module. A telescope is used as a beam reducer to match the beam diameter to the photocathode diameter. A calculated light emission spectrum is shown in figure 3 and the attenuation from the interference filter applied to the lines. The spectrum included the full, half and one third energy components and the effect of different observation angles. Observation of only the Doppler shifted light allows maximization of beam emission signal against the background from the tokamak plasma. There is strong Balmer-α emission from the tokamak plasma due to Edge localised modes (ELMs) which are bursts of particles exhausted from the plasma edge, associated with filaments. With a tritium beam the Doppler shift is slightly less than for a deuterium beam. The full energy component of a tritium beam is shifted to 658.8 nm compared with 659.4 nm for a deuterium beam at 120 kV. This corresponds to a small difference in the attenuation from the filter.

During JET-DTE2 the interference filter was not fitted on the blind fibre for octant 4, but it was fitted for the octant 8 blind fibre. This was a precaution because we did not know how strong the radiation induced luminescence would be or what the emission spectrum was. Having a broad band measurement as well as a narrow band measurement was a cautious way to start. We found that the octant 4 blind fibre signal saturated during the highest neutron production pulses because of this. During the subsequent JET deuterium tritium experiments in 2023 (JET-DTE3), the interference filters were installed on both octant 4 and octant 8 blind fibre measurements.

A schematic for the signal conditioning is given in figure 4. The photomultiplier gain is variable and set with a reference voltage. A custom signal conditioning card with a logarithmic amplifier was designed based on the AD8304 logarithmic converter from analog devices. The AD8304 has a dynamic range of 160 dB and log conformance better than 0.1 dB. Before the logarithmic amplifier, a compensation voltage can be subtracted from the measurement. This allows for blind fibre compensation where background light produced by radiation is subtracted from the measurement. The logarithmic amplifier is used to produce a logarithmic signal voltage 0–10 V which, unlike a linear signal, allows the full dynamic range of the photomultiplier to be recorded with 16-bit sampling. The use of logarithmic amplifiers also simplifies the setting of trip levels over a wide range of conditions. Trip levels were determined during commissioning during deuterium plasma operations and adjusted as operational data was collected. Histograms of the maximum signal seen on each channel per pulse were used to set a trip level as low as possible while allowing a low possibility of a false trip from background light. The beam emission signal is proportional to background pressure which varies over several orders of magnitude. The photomultiplier module was sensitive to light between 300 nm and 850 nm and has a frequency response from DC to 20 kHz. The beam emission light signals are calibrated in Watts but are not traceable to a national calibration standard since that was not necessary for the operation of the interlock. The basis of calibration used here is the data sheet and calibration test for each module identified by serial number which was supplied by the manufacturer. The photomultiplier gain was set and recorded during commissioning. The calibration of the logarithmic amplifier and data acquisition was completed with standard test equipment. The light signals are calibrated at the Balmer-α emission (Dα at 656.1 nm) using the photocathode sensitivity curve. Corrections included the central wavelength transmission of the interference filter on channels that used one, however, as can be seen in figure 3, the attenuation of the filter depends on the wavelength of the Doppler shifted line and not the central value. There is no correction for the end-to-end optical transmission of the optics and fibres as this was not measured.

2.2. Neutron radiation effects
The D–T fusion reaction produces a neutron with energy 14.06 MeV. Up to 4.7 × 1018 n s −1 (JET pulse 99965) were generated at the peak output. The neutron flux depends on the distance from the source and on the shielding. At the location of a JET diagnostic port, the approximate neutron fluence was calculated by the MCNP code [11] as 2.5 × 10−8 n cm−2 per emitted neutron [12].

Radiation effects on optical fibres were studied at the OKTAVIAN neutron source [13]. The OKTAVIAN facility at Osaka University is a high flux D–T neutron source. Fusion neutrons are produced when a high current deuterium beam is incident on a tritium target. Measurements of the transmission of several types of fibre in 100 m length samples demonstrated that the transmission of optical fibres was reduced after exposure to fusion neutrons. The transmission was measured during 24 h of exposure. The total accumulated exposure was 109 − 1010 n cm−2. The transmission was monitored for a further 24 h after exposure and the transmission recovered but never completely returning to the pre-exposure condition. The recovery is called the annealing effect as it is temperature dependent but observed at room temperature in that study. Fibres with doped cores showed the most loss of transmission up to 75 dB km−1 and little recovery after 24 h of annealing. Fibres with a pure silica core show less accumulated loss, 40 dB km−1, and quick recovery to close to original transmission in less than 1 h. There is an amount of permanent damage as no types of fibre recover completely to pre-exposure transmission. Losses after annealing are around 5 dB km−1. There was significant difference between different types of fibres. Pure silica fibres with larger core diameters are less affected than single mode fibres. During the studies on OKTAVIAN radiation induced luminescence was not investigated or observed during the tests. Experiments show that there is a permanent and a temporary neutron radiation damage in optical fibres.

Measurements of luminescence and transmission loss were made for five types of optical fibres during D–D and D–T pulses on the TFTR tokamak [14]. Fibres with different core diameters, (200 μm, 600 μm, 1000 μm) were measured. The fibres were at room temperature and no annealing was done. Both luminescence and transmission loss proportional to neutron fluence was observed. The short-term transmission loss was bigger for smaller diameter fibres. The experiments on TFTR confirmed the finding from OKTAVIAN that neutron damage has permanent and temporary contributions. Measurements of radiation-induced emission and radiation-induced absorption were taken on a 60 m coil of optical fibre located near a JET diagnostic port during the DTE2 and DTE3 experiments [12]. The fibres were not annealed. Measurement of the loss of transmission and recovery showed a recovery of 95% of damage after an hour.

2.3. Heated optical fibres
From published observations [14, 15] there are two known ways to minimise the radiation damage and loss of transmission. The first is to use fibres with a large core diameter as larger diameters are less effected by damage and the second is to heat the fibre so there is continuous annealing of the damage. High temperature optical fibres with an aluminium cladding were used. The ODI fibres core has a 1 mm diameter made from synthetic silica and the cladding is doped silica. The numerical aperture is NA = 0.22. In publications the largest diameter tested was 1 mm and this became a standard for other JET diagnostics where radiation effects are a concern. The disadvantages of large diameter fibres are the significant cost and large minimum bend radius. The fibre transmission includes the UV and visible range from 180 nm to 1200 nm. The optical fibres were inside an insulated heated hose of length 18 m. The fibres were maintained at a temperature of 200 °C by temperature control power supplies. The length of fibre exposed to radiation within the biological shield is 12.5 m, from the diagnostic port where collimators collect light from the neutral beams in the duct area to the penetrations where the fibres leave the JET-torus hall. The distance of the fibres from the centre of the tokamak is between 5.95 m at the diagnostic port and 13.2 m at the floor penetration through the shielding and the closest distance to the mean plasma radius is 3.15 m.

2.4. Configuration of the system during the JET-DTE2 campaign
During the JET-DTE2 campaign the optional blind fibre compensation was not implemented (see figure 4). This was not the optimal way to use the system and indeed this caused false ODI trips as will be described in the next section, but on the positive side, this allowed getting access to the uncompensated ODI channel measurements because data acquisition happens after the compensation circuit.

It is also important to note that the octant 8 blind fibre was fitted with an interference filter, while octant 4 blind fibre was not.

While analysing the ODI signals during JET-DTE2, we have observed that all octant 8 measurements where essentially blind to any plasma light or light from beam emission but during previous experiments they were not. Presumably, this is due to obstruction of the viewing window by sputtered copper coating. In practice, all octant 8 ODI measurements behaved as blind fibres during JET-DTE2 and DTE3.

Referring to figure 4, the light intensity Popt in Watts of all ODI measurements presented in this paper are computed as:

 
where V is the output voltage of the logarithmic amplifier and k is a channel dependant proportionality factor that depends on the calibration, filter, and photomultiplier gain (see also the discussion on calibrations in section 2.1).

3. Behaviour of the ODI signals
3.1. General behaviour of ODI Beam emission measurements
Figure 5 shows signals relevant to the interlock recorded during pulse 99633 with a high neutron production rate. The neutral beam power is plotted for octant 4. For the lines of sight looking at beam emission, the ODI is largely proportional to the neutron production rate in JET fusion plasmas. The octant 4 blind fibre optical signal is also plotted in figure 5; it exhibits a good correspondence with the neutron production rate. The blind fibre signal is much larger than the ODI signal because channel 4 used an interference filter while the blind fibre signal did not. The radiation effects to ODI measurements are caused by neutrons-induced light produced in the optical fibre, and the collection optics and the diagnostic windows. The blind fibre signal can be used to remove the neutron-induced light from the ODI beam emission signal and this blind fibre compensated signal is plotted with the measured signal in plot (b).

The plot of the octant 4 duct pressure shows a maximum of about 5 × 10−6 mbar, which is low and normal for a well-conditioned duct. In the JET-DTE2 campaign, there were very few observations of beam emission with a high enough duct pressure to see the response of the ODI signals to duct pressure above background.

As can been seen on figure 5, the octant 4 ODI measurement signals also exhibit features related to the Balmer-alpha (Da) emission. A zoomed plot to better see the contribution of Balmer-α emission from the edge plasma to the ODI signal is included in figure 6. The regular spikes in emission are caused by bursts ELMs.

3.2. Example of trip from radiation induced light
Figure 8 illustrates a false ODI trip on octant 8 for pulse 99961, a pulse with high fusion power (and neutron production). Readers are reminded that octant 8 ODI measurements were blind from light emitted in the duct. During this pulse the octant 8 pressure, plotted in figure 8(b) remained below 5 × 10−6 mbar. The drop in pressure when the beams turn on is because the gas injection modules closest to the beam ducts are switched off. This example illustrates how neutron induced light (comparison between plot c and plot e) can generate signals above the trip threshold, hence demonstrating the absolute requirement to compensate for this effect when implementing and ODI system in a fusion environment.

3.3. Contributions to the ODI signals
The main contributions to the JET ODI optical signals are: (a) neutron induced light; (b); Da contribution from the JET plasma; (c) Bremsstrahlung radiation contribution from the JET plasma; (e) light from beam emission in the duct (the reason for the ODI interlock). A statistical analysis was conducted on the whole database of pulses with NBI to quantify these contributions. We have assumed that the light Popt (in W) measured by the interlock can be described by a linear model parameterised by:

 
where the a, b, c, d and e parameters are determined from statistical analysis. I is the total neutral beam current in Ampere, P is the neutral beam duct pressure (mbar), N is the fusion neutron production rate (1 s), D is the Balmer-α emission (photons s−1cm−2 sr−1) from the tokamak plasma and B is the tokamak Bremsstrahlung emission (photons s−1cm−2 sr−1). The term aIP gives the Doppler-Shifted Balmer-α beam emission which is proportional to the background gas pressure and the beam current and assumes that the Balmer-α cross-section is constant. This approximation is made because the JET neutral beams are normally operated at similar energies during experiments. Note that in the range 80–125 keV the Balmer-α emission cross section is constant within ± 3%. The parameters in equation (2) were calculated using a minimisation algorithm (scipy.optimize.curve_fit Python routine). Data were resampled to a 20 ms sample rate with interpolation and averaging and pre-processed to remove samples when a signal was off-line, faulty, or saturated. The time window of interest starts one second before the beams operate and continues until one second after the beams switch off. Plasma disruptions were excluded from the database by reducing the window of interest. As a comparison, the model was also fitted to deuterium only plasmas from JET pulses 84312 (2013) to 88229 (2015). This is a period of operation between two JET shutdowns with no changes to the ODI photomultiplier gains. The parameters from the fit are given in table 1 in the appendix.

In figure 9, the predicted light from the linear regression model is plotted against the actual measured light, for the octant 4 (Channel 4) ODI, for all samples and pulses. Another illustration of the quality of the linear regression model is shown in figure 10 for pulse 99950.

Figure 11 summarises the relative contributions to the light measurements for the ODI system (in this example, octant 4 channel 4). As discussed previously, neutron induced light in the system is the main contributor to the measurement, which emphasises experimentally the need to implement a correction for this effect. Plasma emission (Balmer-α and Bremsstrahlung) also contribute substantially and contribute more than the beam emission in this dataset. This also highlights the importance of filtering out, as much as possible, the (non-Doppler shifted) contribution from the plasma. In the JET-DTE2 campaign, the duct pressure remained low which explains the somehow low contribution from beam emission.

3.4. Behaviour of blind fibre measurements
Blind fibre measurements showed a good correlation with the plasma neutron production rate. An example is given in figure 12 for the octant 8 blind fibre. Results for small neutron rates are not shown because the log-amplifier settings were not optimised for small signals.

As the octant 8 measurement window was obscured, octant 8 measurements can be considered as blind fibre measurements as well. Octant 8 channel 4 measurements versus plasma neutron production rate are shown in figure 13 for comparison. The signal level is noticeably higher than for the ‘true’ blind fibre, this is presumably from light produced in the diagnostic window which has a direct line of sight to the plasma and where neutron radiation is not shielded. The vacuum vessel provides some radiation shielding to the optical fibres. Comparing the signals from all channels of octant 8 to the octant 8 blind fibre and assuming that octant 8 windows block all light from the duct we can infer that there is ∼4 times more light generated in the window by neutron radiation than in the optical fibre. The blind fibre on octant 4 does not have an interference filter and measures the broadband light from radiation effects. This leads to a larger signal measured for octant 4 blind fibre measurement. The gradient light/(neutron rate) for the octant 4 blind fibre is 1.81 × 10−27 Ws compared to 3.23 × 10−30 Ws for the octant 8 blind fibre. The higher signal level for the octant 4 blind fibre measurement led to a signal saturation for neutron production rates larger than ∼1.7 × 1018 n s−1.

The effect of radiation induced damage to the fibres was investigated looking at the trends of the octant 8 and octant 4 ODI signals versus accumulated neutrons, the light source being dominated by the neutron induced fluorescence in the windows in the case of the octant 8 ODI measurement channels. A result for octant 8 channel 4 is shown in figure 14, while the result for the octant 4 channel 4 is shown in figure 15. Half of the JET ODI measurement channels show no radiation induced damages in fibres, and the worst-case increase in fibres attenuation (figure 14) is ∼15%, for an accumulated dose rate of ∼7 × 1020 neutrons.

4. Optimum correction for neutron induced light and capability to detect pressure excursions
After the installation of the ODI system duct pressure excursions were rare and complete beam blocking was never seen again. Presumably this is related to a major upgrade of the JET NBI ducts with improved cooling (hypervapotrons) in 2011 [16]. One example of a pressure excursion with the new duct protection is shown in figure 16 from octant 8 for a JET deuterium pulse. At that time octant 8 was not blind and did measure beam emission.

In this later case (b), pressure estimate is from the regression analysis (see section 3.3) on the JET database of pulses with NBI covering 2013–2015 deuterium operations. The beams were switched off after 15.76 s due to the raised pressure.

Standard imageHigh-resolution image
The maximum pressure estimated from beam emission measurements was 7 × 10−4 mbar maximum in this event. The calibration between beam emission and pressure used the method presented in section 3.3 with a database of deuterium pulses (2013–2015). Figure 16 shows the much faster response from the ODI measurement compared with the fast Penning gauge. The slower time response and lower peak pressure measured by the Penning gauge is due to the distance to the sensor and the slower time response of the gauge. The beams were tripped by the high pressure after 15.76 s by the Penning gauge interlock as the ODI was being commissioned at the time and not enabled. This pressure spike did not cause the beam to ionise significantly and there was no growth from heating (from thermocouple measurements) of the duct wall or increased gas emission from the wall.

An analyses was performed to optimise the trip level based on the ODI data collected in JET-DTE2 fusion plasmas: All pulses of the database (with NBI) were simulated assuming a pressure spike similar to the one observed in pulse 84864 (figure 16). It is assumed that midway through the NBI heating pulse a pressure excursion arises. An example is shown in figure 17 where the simulated peak pressure was 3 × 10−4 mbar. Applying the regression coefficients for equation (2), the ODI measurement light could then be estimated using the contribution from a simulated pressure signal (aIP term in equation (2) in place of the measured signal. We have done so without and with compensation for neutron induced light. To apply compensation for neutron induced light, we assumed the neutron contribution to the ODI measured light is linear and used the proportionality factor b of equation (2). For any chosen trip level, the outcome of any analysed pulse will be a correct trip, a false trip, or no trip. The false trip occurs when the background exceeds the trip level at some point during the pulse. A correct trip occurs when the simulated signal exceeds the trip level because of the contribution from the pressure spike. No trip case applies when the trip level is too high.

The trip simulation results are presented in figure 18 (simulated 3 × 10−4 mbar pressure excursion) and figure 19 (simulated 7 × 10−4 mbar pressure excursion), where the ability to trip the system is plotted as a function of the threshold optical power above which the NBI system is stopped (referred as ‘trip level’). The analysis is presented for octant 4, Channel 4. These simulations were performed for a subset of pulses with total NBI PINI current of octant 4 greater than 150 A (total power for octant 4 greater than ∼6 MW). False trips could be produced at low trip level, these false trips are caused by the plasma contributions (Balmer-α, Bremsstrahlung), or the neutron induced light in the system. Optimum trip level is a compromise between minimising the number of false trips (increasing the trip level) and making sure a pressure excursion does trip the system (decreasing the trip level). Adjusting the trip level to an equivalent of ∼0.5 × 10−10 W and using compensated signals would allow ∼100% detection of the pressure excursion without false trips. Neutron effects compensation allows a reduction of the number of false trips, and it is absolutely required to find an acceptable operating point (in terms of trip level) in the case of the smaller pressure excursion (3 × 10−4 mbar). As expected, there is a larger flexibility in adjusting the trip threshold in the case of the larger pressure excursion.

5. Conclusions, lessons learnt and prospects for future systems
Operation of the NBI Systems during the JET-DTE2 campaign was the opportunity to collect data of importance for the understanding of the ODI system in a nuclear fusion environment.

Neutron induced light in the fibres or vacuum window are a large contributor to the Duct Optical signal and compensation is required to obtain an operating point (in terms of trip level) while minimising likelihood of false trips.

Blind fibres can in principle be used to compensate for neutrons radiation induced light in ODI systems. As the neutron radiation contribution to the measured light depends on the details of fibre routing and collection optics, future systems should be flexible enough to allow gain adjustment as proposed in a simplified block diagram in figure 20. As part of the commissioning, gains should ideally be adjusted, optimised, and checked during operation while neutrons are produced, hence a design allowing flexibility in these adjustments and adaptability is highly desirable.

A more advanced scheme where the rising time of the ODI signal is taken into account could also be envisaged (beam blocking is a fast event); this scheme would need to be implemented on a more intelligent platform because it would also need to discriminate dangerous beam blocking events from ELM events.

The accumulated neutron induced fibre damage was quantified: insertion losses in the fibres increased at most ∼15% with our arrangement where fibres were baked to 200 °C. Note that not all measurement channels and blind fibres have the same behaviour (again highlighting the importance of having future ODI systems adaptable), as some fibres showed no accumulated radiation damage. The damage annealing rate achieved at 200 °C appears to be sufficient for the radiation environment seen in JET-DTE2.

The system also critically depends on the discrimination of the light emitted from the plasma from the Doppler shifted Balmer-α from beam emission, and as far as possible, filtering out the plasma emission. Previously we have measured beam emission in the duct without significant background using a different line of sight [4]. It was not possible to use that for the ODI due to installation of other equipment. It is therefore likely that plasma background could be reduced if an optimised window location and line of sight is used.

It is important to have regular checks of light transmission from the beamline during system operations and a strategy to clean the windows. Vacuum windows can be obscured. Due to the tight JET schedule, we did not have the opportunity to clean these windows in the august 2017–2023 period, this is the reason why the whole octant 8 ODI system was blind during the JET-DTE2 campaign. However, we also emphasise that with the JET-EP2 duct with improved cooling, it was very easy to condition the beamlines and the risk of operating without the octant 8 ODI system active was deemed acceptable (relying on a Penning gauge duct pressure interlock).
