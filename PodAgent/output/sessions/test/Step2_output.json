1. There are several primary factors that influence redditor behavior, which I've drawn upon in my research. First and foremost, the community-driven aspect has a significant impact. The upvote and downvote system promotes content that the majority agrees with, often leading to a 'hive mind' mentality. Redditors are also influenced by the norms and rules established within each subreddit, as each community often operates under a distinct social contract. Finally, the anonymous nature of Reddit allows for more open and frank discussions, which can lead to more pronounced behaviors, both positive and negative.

2. The design and functionality of Reddit have a substantial influence on user interaction and behavior. The simple but efficient structure facilitates communication and sharing, making it easier for users to participate in discussions. The Karma system, which relates to upvotes and downvotes, also manipulates behavior by promoting content that users find appealing and discouraging that which they don't. This system creates a unique form of social validation that encourages conformity to the collective opinion of a subreddit community.

3. Reddit users exhibit certain behavioral tendencies that are quite unique compared to other social media users. Firstly, Reddit users, or 'Redditors,' value meaningful and detailed content. Posts that demonstrate thoughtfulness, research, or personal experience often receive high levels of engagement. Secondly, there's a blending of humor and seriousness. For instance, even in serious subreddits, a witty comment that's still relevant is appreciated. Lastly, there's an element of supportiveness, particularly evident within some specific communities. Redditors usually provide genuine support and helpful advice, whether the discussion is about a serious life issue or a hobby.

4. The anonymous nature of Reddit greatly influences user behaviors and interactions. Anonymity affords users a level of freedom that they may not have on other platforms such as Facebook or Instagram. This can result in greater honesty in discussions and the ability to share more personal or controversial views without fear of being judged by friends, colleagues, or family. However, it can also lead to people behaving with less empathy or decency given the perceived lack of consequences.

5. Reddit has a multilayer approach in fostering positive user behavior. This includes clear site-wide rules prohibiting harassment, hate speech, and personal attacks. It also relies heavily on moderators for individual subreddits to enforce community-specific guidelines. To further discourage negative interactions, it could expand upon the present Karma system by offering more tangible rewards for positive interactions. This could include highlighting good digital citizenship or fostering subreddits centered around positive discussions and support. Implementing stricter repercussions for breaking rules could also be beneficial. At the end of the day, maintaining a safe and positive community requires ongoing effort and adaptation to the ever-changing landscape of online behavior.

1. The primary factors that influence redditor behavior are manifold. Primarily, the community or subreddit users choose to engage with plays a crucial role because every subreddit has its own rules, topics of discussion, and internal culture. Another significant factor includes the nature of the content posted and the thread it fosters. As a data scientist, I've noticed that posts which invoke emotion or call for engagement on a relatable topic increase user interaction significantly. 

2. The design and functionality of Reddit indeed play a major role in user interaction. Reddit's straightforward design encourages users to dive into content quickly, making them more likely to engage. However, the aspect of functionality which makes a bigger impact is the voting system - upvotes and downvotes. This core feature adds a layer of user moderation to the content and influences user behavior, as it allows the "best" or "most relevant" content to rise to the top.

3. Some behavioral tendencies unique to Reddit users involve the exploration of niche interests and communal learning. Unlike other platforms, Reddit does a wonderful job of condensing various unique interests into digestible, community-driven subgroups or subreddits. This leads to users delving into deep, specific fields, something less observed on other platforms. Another routine behaviour is the usage of throwaway accounts for sensitive or controversial topics, allowing users to speak freely while maintaining their primary account's reputation.

4. The anonymous nature of Reddit indeed impacts user behaviors and interactions. It offers users a level of privacy which isn't typically found on other major social platforms. This function gives users the confidence to voice controversial or unpopular viewpoints, fostering a more diverse range of discussions. However, it also has a downside, as this anonymity occasionally gives rise to trolls or harmful behaviors.

5. Approaches to cultivate positive behavior on Reddit range from subreddit moderation to machine learning algorithms. For instance, moderating teams enforce subreddit-specific rules and guidelines to maintain respect and cooperation within the community. On a larger scale, Reddit uses machine learning algorithms to take action against prohibited content such as hate speech or harassment. For future improvements, Reddit could enhance its user verifications to discourage troll accounts, maybe by linking actions to an account reputation system, which might help to further encourage positive interactions and discourage negative behaviors.
