{audio_type: "speech", layout: "foreground", character: "Dr. Emily Rosen", vol: -15, text: "Certainly.

{audio_type: "speech", layout: "foreground", character: "Samuel Hughes", vol: -15, text: "Well, echoing Dr. Rosen's points, the community or subreddit that users choose to be a part of heavily influences their behavior.

{audio_type: "speech", layout: "foreground", character: "Samuel Hughes", vol: -15, text: "Absolutely.

{audio_type: "speech", layout: "foreground", character: "Dr. Emily Rosen", vol: -15, text: "Well, this anonymity provides users the freedom to voice personal or controversial views without fear of judgment.

{audio_type: "speech", layout: "foreground", character: "Dr. Emily Rosen", vol: -15, text: "Reddit enforces clear site rules and relies heavily on moderators to manage each subreddit's norms.

{audio_type: "speech", layout: "foreground", character: "Samuel Hughes", vol: -15, text: "Reddit uses both human moderation and machine learning algorithms to enforce rules and take actions against inappropriate content.
